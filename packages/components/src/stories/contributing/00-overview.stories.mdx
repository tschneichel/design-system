# Overview

We love contributions. Please note, that feature requests and changes have always first to be approved by the Design System core team before [pull request](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pulls) can be created.

## Introduction

The Baloise Design System is free to use for anybody building a Baloise product or website. The Design System community is working day by day in order to make the product better. Contributors are relevant for product success, so we are glad that you found this section.  

Contributions are not limited to code. We also encourage you to give feedback, improve documentation, improve designs, or suggest new tools.

All you need is a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/) to get started. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue using one of these templates:

- [Ask a question](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=question.md)
- [Report a bug](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=)
- [Request a feature](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature-request.md&title=)
